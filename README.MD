# robots
A smart React App that will allow you to search in real time through a list of robots.

Using the "build-react-app" install, I have compiled a build to be deployed easily as a HTML page, so it displays as it should, while 
using through Github.

Currently uses a static database to fill the names/emails - the next stage will be adding a form to submit your name (and bot) to the robot list. (Which uses the https://robohash.org/ API)
